# Software Engineering Summative 1 Assignment
### Assignment Aim üéØ
The aim of this assignment is to create a simple web app written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and to document the full project using a project management tool such as Github. 

To achieve this outcome, many steps were undertaken to replicate a software development project. The flow can be seen in figure 1 and is explained in further detail below.

</p>

Initially, the design concept of the simple app should be sketched / created on a computer to show the desired appearance and potentially some functionality of the idea to help the development teams. Once the design has been decided, a project should be created using a project management tool such as Github or Jira. For this assignment, Github was used as it is free to use. Numerous tickets known as issues are raised by the design team in the project. Each issue/ticket is a specific requirement for the project completion. An example of a ticket could be that the title should be the font Arial, size 24 and centred on the page. 

A development team are then assigned the tickets and as they are completed submitted for approval using a pull request. If approved, then the specific code created for the project gets added to the main code. It is worth noting that some code should also be provided with certain test files, to validate the code is working as stated. 

Once all tickets are approved and the tickets are closed, the main code should contain all the information to provide the desired outcome of the design team. This assignment will work through this methodology to produce the simple web app. 

***Note from the author: The assignment was to show understanding of the whole process and not purely on the level of coding. It was encouraged to have fun with this project, so I hope you enjoy the topic of my simple web app!***

## üçå Banana For Scale üçå

### Introduction

To keep the project fun and interesting, I chose to create a simple web app based on a popular internet meme that originated in 2005, known as ‚ÄúBanana for Scale‚Äù (Know your meme, 2014). It first originated on a blog called Rockdogdesigns with a description that a TV was for sale. Below is the original post.

It then became a form of joke on the internet as the banana size had no defined length but was being used to compare the size of items from animals to furniture, especially on the popular internet site Reddit, where the topic has its own subreddit for posts specifically dedicated to this topic (https://www.reddit.com/r/BananasForScale/).

### Design & Functionality

As the assignment task was to keep the coding simple, the approach to the web app was to create a simple calculator to take an input of a length or distance and divide by a fixed value specified for the size of the banana size to explain how many bananas were equivalent to the input length.

### Prototyping in Figma - Image and Functionality

Figure 4 shows the prototyping from basic layout to final apperance created on Figma. The initial wire frame was just to show a rough layout of the key items required based on the above flow chart. The second image adds more clarity to the text that will appear as the web app is used. Finally the third picture shows the colours and images created for the app as a final proposed design. Playful fonts, colour and images were used based on the light hearted topic of the app!

Figma was also used to preview some basic functionality of the app. In this prototype, the blue arrow attached to the yellow button "How many bananas?" is connected to a second page with the heading calculation. In the prototype mode, clicking on the yellow button takes the user to this second page, which also produces an output number. This is not a calculation but purely to demonstrate the basic functionality of the app. This prototyping tool was useful as it helped open up new ideas and requirements of the design.

### Creating a list of issues
A ticketing system was created to list all the features required for the project. The idea is that one ticket / issue is created for each feature required. Each item is then created on a seperate branch which is then submitted to Github as a pull request. If the approver approves of the changes and they meet the requirement, then the updated information can be pushed to the main code.
